# Handler contract

What every handler in `kb-core/handlers/<chip>/` provides. A handler turns one platform-free driver into a
thread-safe, `kb::Status`-speaking object that a board HAL can own. There is one handler family.

## Files and names

```text
kb-core/handlers/<chip>/
├── <Chip>Handler.h / .cpp      the handler: class kb::<Chip>Handler
├── Hal<Bus><Chip>Comm.h / .cpp  the adapter: implements the driver's port with Base* calls, plus ToStatus()
└── <Chip><Periph>Wrapper.h      optional: presents part of the chip as a Base* (BaseAdc, BaseGpio, ...)
```

- Handlers live in `namespace kb`: `kb::Zp100Handler`, `kb::Tmc9660Handler`.
- Adapters are named `Hal{Bus}{Chip}Comm`: `HalSpiTmc9660Comm`, `HalUartTmc9660Comm`, `HalI2cZp100Comm`.
- Each handler compiles only when its switch is on: `KB_ENABLE_<CHIP>` (the single feature switch,
  [library.md](library.md#kb-core-build)). Its driver is a submodule in `drivers/driver-<chip>/`, pinned to a
  release tag, and has an entry in `catalog/compat.yml`.
- Includes use one style: `#include "kb/interfaces/BaseI2c.h"`, `#include "zp100.hpp"`,
  `#include "kb/rtos/RtosMutex.h"`.

## Shape

```cpp
namespace kb {

struct Zp100HandlerConfig {
  uint8_t address = 0x47;
  zp100::Config driver{};
};

struct Zp100Diagnostics {
  DiagnosticsHeader header;          // always first
  uint32_t fifo_overflows = 0;       // chip-specific counters follow
};

class Zp100Handler {
public:
  Zp100Handler(BaseI2c& i2c, const Zp100HandlerConfig& config = {},
               RtosMutex* bus_mutex = nullptr) noexcept;   // stores references; no I/O
  Zp100Handler(const Zp100Handler&) = delete;
  Zp100Handler& operator=(const Zp100Handler&) = delete;

  Result<void> EnsureInitialized() noexcept;   // builds the driver in place, runs its EnsureInitialized()
  Result<void> Deinitialize() noexcept;
  [[nodiscard]] bool IsInitialized() const noexcept;

  Result<float> ReadPressurePa() noexcept;     // the typed API: each call locks, maps, counts

  template <typename Fn>
  Status VisitDriver(Fn&& fn) noexcept;        // fn(zp100::ZP100<HalI2cZp100Comm>&) -> Status

  [[nodiscard]] Zp100Diagnostics GetDiagnostics() const noexcept;

private:
  using Driver = zp100::ZP100<HalI2cZp100Comm>;

  HalI2cZp100Comm comm_;
  std::optional<Driver> driver_;   // in place: no heap
  Zp100HandlerConfig config_;
  mutable RtosMutex mutex_;
  RtosMutex* bus_mutex_;
  Zp100Diagnostics diag_{};
};

} // namespace kb
```

## Rules

### Construction and lifecycle

- The constructor MUST NOT touch hardware, create the driver or allocate. It stores references to `Base*`
  interfaces that the HAL owns and that outlive the handler.
- Handlers are neither copyable nor movable.
- Driver storage is in place: `std::optional<Driver>` (or aligned storage) emplaced by `EnsureInitialized()`.
  `make_unique`, `new` and `nothrow new` are not allowed.
- `EnsureInitialized()` returns `Result<void>`. On first call it emplaces the driver over the adapter and runs the
  driver's `EnsureInitialized()`; on failure it destroys the driver again, so the next call retries from scratch.
  It returns at once when already initialised.
- `EnsureInitialized()` is the handler's one start-up entry point
  ([ADR-0021](../adr/0021-one-start-up-entry-point.md)). Reads and writes do not call it: every public method
  that needs the chip returns `NotInitialized` until the handler has been started, which the HAL does once, in its
  fixed start-up order.
- `Deinitialize()` runs the driver's `Deinitialize()` and destroys it.

### Locking

- Each handler has its own `RtosMutex` (from `kb::rtos`, [threading-and-timing.md](threading-and-timing.md)).
  Every public method takes it with `MutexLockGuard` for its whole duration.
- Devices that share a bus MAY share a bus mutex passed to the constructor. The order is always handler mutex,
  then bus mutex, and both are released before the method returns.
- A handler MUST NOT call another handler while holding its locks.

### Driver access

- There is no public `GetDriver()`, raw driver pointer or reference. Code that needs a driver feature the typed
  API does not wrap uses `VisitDriver()`:

  ```cpp
  uint32_t fifo_level = 0;
  kb::Status s = zp100.VisitDriver([&](auto& drv) {
    auto r = drv.ReadFifoLevel();
    fifo_level = r.value;
    return kb::ToStatus(r.error);
  });
  ```

- `VisitDriver()` takes the handler lock (and the bus lock), returns `NotInitialized` without calling `fn` if the
  handler is not initialised, otherwise calls `fn` with the driver and returns its `Status`. `fn` MUST NOT store the
  reference.
- A feature used through `VisitDriver()` in more than one place SHOULD become a typed method.

### Errors

- Typed methods return `kb::Result<T>`. Driver errors are mapped once, by the `ToStatus(<chip>::Error)` in the
  adapter header ([errors.md](errors.md#driver-error-to-kbstatus)), with the driver code as `detail`.
- Handlers MUST NOT return driver result types, `esp_err_t` or `bool` from a call that can fail.

### The adapter

- The adapter derives from the driver's port base (`zp100::I2cInterface<HalI2cZp100Comm>`) and implements its
  hooks with `BaseI2c` / `BaseSpi` / `BaseUart` / `BaseGpio` calls. It translates `kb_*_err_t` failures into
  `false`, which the driver reports as `Error::Bus`.
- The delay hooks call `kb::DelayUs()` / `kb::DelayMs()` from `handlers/common/`, which follow
  [threading-and-timing.md](threading-and-timing.md#delays); the `Log` hook forwards to the kb-core logger.
- Shared adapter bases in `handlers/common/` (`HalSpiCommBase`, `HalI2cCommBase`, `HalUartCommBase`) hold the bus
  reference, the CS / pin mapping and the delay and log hooks, so a new adapter only adds what is chip-specific.

### Diagnostics

Every handler has `GetDiagnostics()`, returning a struct whose first member is the common header:

```cpp
namespace kb {

struct DiagnosticsHeader {
  bool initialized = false;
  uint32_t ok_count = 0;          // calls that returned Ok
  uint32_t error_count = 0;       // calls that returned anything else
  Status last_error = Status::Ok;
  uint16_t last_error_detail = 0; // the driver's Error value
  uint64_t last_error_us = 0;     // kb::MonotonicUs() at the last error
};

} // namespace kb
```

The header is updated by the handler on every typed call and every `VisitDriver()`. Chip-specific counters and
sticky chip status follow it. `GetDiagnostics()` takes the lock, copies, and returns.

### Wrappers

A wrapper that presents part of a chip as a `Base*` (`Tmc9660AdcWrapper`, a `BaseGpio` per expander pin) is owned
by the handler in a fixed array, created by `EnsureInitialized()`, and forwards through the handler's locked API.
It is not created with `std::shared_ptr` or on demand.

### Platform and product independence

- Handlers include only `Base*` headers, drivers, `kb/rtos/`, `kb/utils/` and `kb/handlers/common/`
  ([layers.md](layers.md#includes)). They compile for every MCU family and on the host.
- A handler MUST NOT take `gpio_num_t`, return `esp_err_t`, or contain `#ifdef` blocks for one MCU or product. A
  chip that needs an MCU peripheral directly (WS2812 on the RMT) has a `Base*` interface for it, implemented in
  `interfaces/mcu/<family>/`, and a row in the MCU gate table ([layers.md](layers.md#mcu-specific-code)).
- What a product chooses (channels in use, profiles, limits) comes in through the handler config or a table passed
  in, never through a product macro ([layers.md](layers.md#product-specific-code)).

## Tests

- Every handler has a host test in `kb-core/tests/host/` that builds it over a fake `Base*` and the driver's mock:
  construction does no I/O, `EnsureInitialized()` retries after failure, every typed method maps a bus failure to
  `Status::Bus`, `VisitDriver()` refuses before init, and the diagnostics header counts.
- The test runs with `KB_RTOS=NONE` and `KB_MCU=HOST`.
